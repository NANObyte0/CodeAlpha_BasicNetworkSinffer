# CodeAlpha_BasicNetworkSinffer
This project uses Python libraries like scapy or socket to listen to network interfaces, capture packets, and decode their structure. It provides insight into the underlying protocols (such as TCP, UDP, ICMP) and allows users to study the details of network communication for learning and troubleshooting purposes.
